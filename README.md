This mini-game is a small demonstration of my coding abilities :D. It's nothing hardcore, just a little ping-pong game. I chose this partly because the project I'm currently working on is unfinished and partly because I found the process of making it really enjoyable. For example, I added cheat code, simulations of gravity and friction into the game to make it fun.

To play this game, all the files in this repository should be placed in the same folder, then simply click ‘乒乓 V2.9’. 
1) Use W and S to control the movement of the left racket, use up and down keys to control the right racket, press space to set a new ball.
2) If the ball hits the net and bounces back, you can't hit it
3) [cheat code] If you type the string ‘iop’ the ball will fly in the opposite direction; type ‘jkl’ then the net will grow taller; type ‘bnm’ then the net will grow shorter ;)
